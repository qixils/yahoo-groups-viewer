		Note: The data on this website comes from Archive Team's periodic archives of Yahoo! Groups between
		October 2015 and October 2018, with most of the Mario Kart groups being archived around late 2017
		and early 2018. This means that a few years of data before the shutdown of Yahoo! Groups are missing.
		Archives of groups after the shutdown of the website exist, however they are in a format which makes
		searching and extracting data from them particularly difficult. This data will nonetheless eventually
		be extracted, however this may take several weeks or months depending on my free time and patience.
